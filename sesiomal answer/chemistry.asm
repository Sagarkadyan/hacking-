Q16. Explain the forms of hydrogen atom wave functions and their plots.

The hydrogen atom wave functions are solutions to the Schrödinger equation. These are called orbitals and are defined by three quantum numbers:

    Principal quantum number (n) – defines energy level and size

    Azimuthal quantum number (l) – defines shape (s, p, d, f)

    Magnetic quantum number (m) – defines orientation

The wave function ψ depends on both radial and angular parts. For example:

    1s orbital is spherical and non-directional.

    2p orbital has a dumbbell shape and is directional.

The radial distribution function shows the probability of finding an electron at a particular distance from the nucleus. Plots of ψ² give us visual representations of electron clouds.
Q17. Explain the π-molecular orbitals of butadiene.

Butadiene (CH₂=CH–CH=CH₂) is a conjugated diene with four π electrons. According to Molecular Orbital Theory:

    The 4 p-orbitals (from the 4 carbon atoms) combine to form 4 π molecular orbitals: Ψ₁, Ψ₂ (bonding), Ψ₃*, Ψ₄* (antibonding).

    Electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first (Ψ₁ and Ψ₂).

Key points:

    Delocalization: The π electrons are spread across the molecule, increasing stability.

    HOMO and LUMO: Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (Ψ₂), Lowest Unoccupied (Ψ₃*) are critical in reactivity and UV-Vis absorption.

    The energy diagram and phase diagrams illustrate constructive and destructive overlaps.

Q18. Explain bending vibrations in IR spectroscopy.

Bending vibrations (also called deformation vibrations) occur when bond angles change. There are two main types:

    In-plane bending:

        Scissoring – atoms move toward each other like scissors.

        Rocking – atoms move in the same direction.

    Out-of-plane bending:

        Wagging – atoms move up and down together.

        Twisting – one atom moves up while the other moves down.

These vibrations usually occur at lower frequencies than stretching vibrations. They are useful in identifying functional groups in IR spectroscopy.
Q19. Explain applications of IR Spectroscopy.

IR spectroscopy is widely used in both qualitative and quantitative analysis:

    Identification of functional groups (e.g., OH, C=O, NH):

        Each bond has a characteristic absorption frequency.

    Structure determination:

        Helps confirm the presence of specific linkages.

    Quality control in pharmaceuticals and polymer industries.

    Environmental monitoring:

        Detects pollutants like CO₂, SO₂.

    Forensic analysis:

        Fiber and drug identification.

    Food industry:

        Tests adulterants, moisture content.

Q20. Discuss in detail electronegativity.

Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a bond.

    Pauling scale is the most common, where fluorine is assigned 4.0.

    Other scales: Mulliken, Allred-Rochow.

Trends in the periodic table:

    Increases across a period (more nuclear charge)

    Decreases down a group (more shielding)

Applications:

    Predicting bond polarity

    Determining ionic or covalent character

    Influences acid/base behavior and reactivity

Example: In HCl, Cl is more electronegative and pulls the electron density, making the bond polar.
Q21. Discuss in detail ionization energy and electron affinity.

Ionization Energy (IE):

    The energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom.

    First IE < Second IE < Third IE (due to increasing nuclear attraction)

Electron Affinity (EA):

    Energy released when an atom gains an electron.

    High EA: Halogens

    Low or negative EA: Noble gases, some alkaline earth metals

Trends:

    IE increases across a period and decreases down a group.

    EA becomes more negative across a period.

Applications:

    Determines reactivity (e.g., alkali metals vs. halogens)

    Helps explain formation of cations and anions.

Q22. Write a short note on entropy and how we can estimate it.

Entropy (S) is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system.

    Higher entropy → more disorder

    Gases have more entropy than liquids, which have more than solids.

Mathematically,
ΔS=qrevT
ΔS=Tqrev​​

where qrevqrev​ is reversible heat and TT is temperature.

Standard molar entropy (S⁰) is tabulated for various substances at 298 K.

Estimation:

    From calorimetry data

    Using statistical mechanics: S=kln⁡WS=klnW

Entropy increases in spontaneous processes (Second Law of Thermodynamics).
Q23. Write a short note on Nernst equation and applications.

Nernst Equation relates cell potential to ion concentrations:
E=E∘−RTnFln⁡Q
E=E∘−nFRT​lnQ

At 25°C:
E=E∘−0.0591nlog⁡Q
E=E∘−n0.0591​logQ

Where:

    E∘E∘: Stand
