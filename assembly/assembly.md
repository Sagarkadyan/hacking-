Assembly is not a language it  is set of languages 
the syntax fo different assembly dependaon your cpu like 32-bit,64-bit,mobilecpu and rasberry pi here 
the syntax will based on 32-bit or i386(oth are same)


Properties of assebmbly
It give more control than any other language
Its not portable because of cpu thing
You have to writ emore code for same task
Iis basically machine code in Human readable form


 WHat is CPU
 Cpu is a machine which follow  a set of instruction to perform a specific task 

 CPU Feature
 
 
 1.Register 
     this is like a  temporary memory if you want to perform a task tehn data will come here and during thr task data
     will stay here and after  calculations the result will be save in permanent location   
     I is basicly a working memory


    There are different type of register 
       ecplained later


    The size of register depend on your cpu artitechiture
    hese have backward compactblity  like i we have  a 32 bit code runnin gin a 64 bit cpu  a the will 
    provide half register to run the code 
2.STACK 
   This is a region of memory which act as last in and first out(LIFO Data Structure) 
   like a stack of book book ebter from top (store ) and exit from bottom(to read)
   an sack is impleted as a contiguous array in array


   contigous array is an array which srore data in contiguos region(a region which is connedtes or adjacent to memory without gap) 

   pushing and popping are done through by moving an index or a pointer and this poime 
   holds the  lacation of he top of stack and it is uptaded as  item are pushed into the stck
